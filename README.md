## About the Game
The game has been created on the programming language ‘Python’, with the assistance of the library ‘pygame’. It also involves basic arcade images and sound effects.

## Prerequisites
The game merely requires the python library ‘pygame’ to be present on the user’s system. It can be installed by running the following command in the Terminal:

>pip install pygame –pre 

Then, the user merely has to download the game folder and run the game file.


## Game Instructions:
•Connect Four is a 2-player game. Players alternate taking turns. There is one colour for each player.

•When it is your turn, click on any of the columns. This will change the colour of the lowest black circle in that column.

•The goal of Connect Four is to get 4 of your colour circles in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does.
